Hello!

Welcome to my repository, where I share my projects and experiments with the PyTorch library. I'm currently exploring the nuances of PyTorch to improve my knowledge of neural networks, machine learning, among others.

## About this Repository

This repository is a space dedicated to my ongoing learning with PyTorch. Here, you will find projects ranging from simple experiments to more complex implementations. My goal is to learn, grow and, of course, share knowledge with the community.

## Key Features

- [Pytorch learning 00](https://github.com/GubioGL/Aprendendo_pytorch/blob/main/pytorch_leaning_00_pynb.ipynb): Introduction to the basic concepts of addition, multiplication, dtype, tensor, device ....
- [Pytorch learning 01](https://github.com/GubioGL/Aprendendo_pytorch/blob/main/pytorch_leaning_01_pynb.ipynb): Pytorch workflow fundamentals> data train, simple neural network class, loss fucntion, how to optimize parameters step-by-step, apply in regression problem.
- [Pytorch learning 01-GPU](https://github.com/GubioGL/Aprendendo_pytorch/blob/main/pytorch_leaning_01_GPU.ipynb): Pytorch workflow fundamentals with GPU: Apply in regression problem..
- [Pytorch learning 02](https://github.com/GubioGL/Aprendendo_pytorch/blob/main/pytorch_learning_02.ipynb): In this notbook we apply the previous knowledge to the problems of  binary classification.
- [Pytorch learning 03](https://github.com/GubioGL/Aprendendo_pytorch/blob/main/pytorch_learning_03.ipynb): Now we  try to use the covolutional neural network for computer vision problem with MNIST Dataset
