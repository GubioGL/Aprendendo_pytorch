# Projects and Experiments with PyTorch

Hello!

Welcome to my repository, where I share my projects and experiments with the PyTorch library. I'm currently exploring the nuances of PyTorch to improve my knowledge of neural networks, machine learning, among others.

## About this Repository

This repository is a space dedicated to my ongoing learning with PyTorch. Here, you will find projects ranging from simple experiments to more complex implementations. My goal is to learn, grow and, of course, share knowledge with the community.

## Key Features

- [Introdução ao Pytorch](https://github.com/GubioGL/Aprendendo_pytorch/blob/main/pytorch_leaning_00_pynb.ipynb): Introduction to the basic concepts of addition, multiplication, dtype, tensor, device ....
- [Projeto 01](https://github.com/GubioGL/Aprendendo_pytorch/blob/main/pytorch_leaning_01_pynb.ipynb): Pytorch workflow fundamentals> data train, simple neural network class, loss fucntion, how to optimize parameters step-by-step
- [Projeto 01-GPU](https://github.com/GubioGL/Aprendendo_pytorch/blob/main/pytorch_leaning_01_GPU.ipynb): Pytorch workflow fundamentals with GPU.
- [E assim por diante...]
